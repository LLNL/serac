Axom Quickstart Guide
=====================

Serac
****

Serac is a 3D implicit nonlinear thermal-structural simulation code. It's primary purpose is to investigate multiphysics abstraction strategies and implicit finite element-based alogrithm development for emerging computing architectures. It also serves as a proxy-app for LLNL's DIABLO and ALE3D codes.
