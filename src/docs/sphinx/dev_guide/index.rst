Developing a New Physics Module
-------------------------------

Developers have two workflows for creating new physics modules:

1. Creating a new multi-physics module from existing physics modules.
#. Creating a new single physics PDE simulation module.

In the first case, construct the new physics module by including existing physics modules by composition. See the `Thermal solid mechanics <../../doxygen/html/classserac_1_1ThermalSolid.html>`_ module for an example.

For the second case, starting with an existing physics module and re-writing it as necessary is a good practice. The following steps describe creation of a new physics module:

1. Create a new class derived from `BasePhysics <../../doxygen/html/classserac_1_1BasePhysics.html>`_.
#. In the constructor, create new ``std::shared_ptrs`` to `FiniteElementStates <../../doxygen/html/classserac_1_1FiniteElementState.html>`_ corresponding to each state variable in your PDE.
#. Link these states to the state pointer array in the ``BasePhysics`` class.
#. Create methods for defining problem parameters (e.g. material properties and sources).
#. Create methods for defining boundary conditions. These should be stored as `BoundaryConditions <../../doxygen/html/classserac_1_1BoundaryCondition.html>`_ and managed in the ``BasePhysics``'s `BoundaryConditionManager <../../doxygen/html/classserac_1_1BoundaryConditionManager.html>`_.
#. Override the virtual ``completeSetup()`` method. This should include construction of all of the data structures needed for advancing the timestep of the PDE.
#. Override the virtual ``advanceTimestep()`` method. This should solve the discretized PDE based on the chosen time integration method. This often requires defining ``mfem::Operators`` to use MFEM-based nonlinear and time integration methods. 

Important Data Structures
