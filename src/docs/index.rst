Serac
=======

Serac is a 3D implicit nonlinear thermal-structural simulation code. Its primary purpose is to investigate multiphysics abstraction
strategies and implicit finite element-based algorithm development for emerging computing architectures. It also serves as a proxy-app for LLNL's
Smith code and heavily leverages the `MFEM finite element library <https://mfem.org/>`_. 

.. note::
   This project is under heavy development and is currently a pre-alpha release. Functionality and interfaces may change rapidly
   as development progresses.
