Serac
=======

Serac is a 3D implicit nonlinear thermal-structural simulation code. It's primary purpose is to investigate multiphysics abstraction
strategies and implicit finite element-based alogrithm development for emerging computing architectures. It also serves as a proxy-app for
LLNL's DIABLO and ALE3D codes.

======================
Quickstart Guide
======================

Getting Serac
-------------

Serac is hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/LLNL/serac>`_. Serac uses git submodules, so the project must be cloned recursively. Use either of the following commands to pull Serac's repository:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Using SSH keys setup with GitHub
   $ git clone --recursive git@github.com:LLNL/serac.git

   # Using HTTPS which works for everyone but is slightly slower and will require username/password
   # for some commands
   $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/LLNL/serac.git

Preparing Windows WSL/Ubuntu for Serac installation
---------------------------------------------------------

For faster installation of the Serac dependencies via Spack on Windows WSL/Ubuntu systems, install cmake, MPICH, openblas, OpenGL, and the devtools
using the following commands for Ubuntu 20.04:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo apt-get update
   $ sudo apt-get upgrade
   $ sudo apt-get install cmake libopenblas-dev libopenblas-base mpich mesa-common-dev libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev cppcheck doxygen libreadline-dev
   $ sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/* /usr/lib

and the following commands for Ubuntu 18.04:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo apt-get update
   $ sudo apt-get upgrade
   $ sudo apt-get install g++-8 gcc-8
   $ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-8 800 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-8
   $ sudo apt-get install cmake libopenblas-dev libopenblas-base mpich mesa-common-dev libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev cppcheck doxygen libreadline-dev
   $ sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/* /usr/lib

Note that the last line is required since Spack expects the system libraries to exist in a directory named ``lib``. During the third
party library build phase, the appropriate Spack config directory must be specified using either 
``python scripts/uberenv/uberenv.py --spack-config-dir=scripts/uberenv/spack_configs/linux_ubuntu_18`` or
``python scripts/uberenv/uberenv.py --spack-config-dir=scripts/uberenv/spack_configs/linux_ubuntu_20`` as appropriate.

Building Serac's Developer Tools
--------------------------------

.. note::
  This can be skipped if you are not doing Serac development or if you are on an LC machine.
  We have them installed for you in a public space defined in 
  ``host-config/<machine name>-<SYS_TYPE>-<compiler>.cmake``

Serac developers utilizes some industry standard development tools in their everyday work.  We build
these with Spack and have them installed in a public space on the LC machines we use. These are
defined in the host-configs in our repository for the machines we support.

If you wish to build them yourself (which takes a long time), use one of the following commands:

For LC machines: 

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python scripts/llnl/build_devtools.py --directory=<devtool/build/path>

For other machines:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python scripts/uberenv/uberenv.py --project-json=scripts/uberenv/devtools.json --prefix=<devtool/build/path>

Unlike Serac's library dependencies, our developer tools can be built with any compiler because
they are not linked into the serac executable.  We recommend GCC 8 because we have tested that they all
build with that compiler.

Building Serac's Dependencies
-----------------------------

.. note::
  This is optional if you are on an LC machine we have previously built the dependencies.  You
  can see these machines and configurations in the ``host-configs`` repository directory.

Serac only directly requires `MFEM <https://mfem.org/>`_.  Though to fully utilize MFEM's capabilities
we need to build 5 other libraries (Hypre, METIS, ParMETIS, SuperLU, and zlib).

The easiest path to build Serac's dependencies is to use `Spack <https://github.com/spack/spack>`_.
This has been encapsulated using `Uberenv <https://github.com/LLNL/uberenv>`_. Uberenv helps by
doing the following:

* Pulls a blessed version of Spack locally
* If you are on a known operating system (like TOSS3), we have defined compilers and system packages
  so you don't have to rebuild the world
* Installs our Spack packages into the local Spack
* Simplifies whole dependency build into one command

Uberenv will create a directory ``uberenv_libs`` containing a Spack instance with the required Serac
dependencies installed. It also generates a host-config file (``<config_dependent_name>.cmake``)
at the root of Serac repository. This host-config defines all the required information for building
Serac.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python scripts/uberenv/uberenv.py

.. note::
  On LC machines, it is good practice to do the build step in parallel on a compute node.
  Here is an example command: ``srun -ppdebug -N1 --exclusive python scripts/uberenv/uberenv.py``

Unless otherwise specified Spack will default to a compiler.  This is generally not a good idea when
developing large codes. To specify which compiler to use add the compiler spec to the ``--spec`` Uberenv
command line option. On TOSS3, we recommend and have tested ``--spec=%clang@4.0.0``.  More compiler specs
can be found in the Spack compiler files in our repository: 
``scripts/uberenv/spack_configs/<System type>/compilers.yaml``.

Some helpful uberenv options:  

* ``--spec=+debug``
* ``--spec=+glvis``
* ``--spec=%clang@4.0.0``
* ``--spec=%clang@4.0.0+debug``
* ``--spack-config-dir=<Path to spack configuration directory>``
* ``--prefix=<Path to uberenv build directory (defaults to ./uberenv_libs)>``

If you already have a spack instance you would like to reuse, you can do so changing the uberenv
command as follow:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python scripts/uberenv/uberenv.py --upstream=</path/to/my/spack>/opt/spack

Building Serac
--------------

Serac uses a CMake build system that wraps its configure step with a script
called ``config-build.py``.  This script creates a build directory and
runs the necessary CMake command for you. You just need to point the script
at the generated or a provided host-config. This can be accomplished with
one of the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   # If you built Serac's dependencies yourself
   $ python ./config-build.py -hc <config_dependent_name>.cmake

   # If you are on an LC machine and want to use our dependencies
   $ python ./config-build.py -hc host-configs/<machine name>-<SYS_TYPE>-<compiler>.cmake

Once the build has been configured, Serac can be built with the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd build-<system-and-toolchain>
   $ make -j16

.. note::
  On LC machines, it is good practice to do the build step in parallel on a compute node.
  Here is an example command: ``srun -ppdebug -N1 --exclusive make -j16``

We provide the following useful build targets that can be run from the build directory:

* ``test``: Runs our unit tests
* ``docs``: Builds our documentation to the following locations:
   
   * Sphinx: ``build-*/src/docs/html/index.html``
   * Doxygen: ``/build-*/src/docs/html/doxygen/html/index.html``

* ``style``: Runs styling over source code and replaces files in place
* ``check``: Runs a set of code checks over source code (CppCheck and clang-format)
