# Change the copyright date in all files that contain the text

# We restrict to this subset of files
# since we do not want to modify files we do not own (e.g., other repos
# included as submodules). Note that this file and *.git files are omitted
# as well.
#
# IMPORTANT: Since this file is not modified (it is running the shell
# script commands), you must EDIT THE COPYRIGHT DATES ABOVE MANUALLY.
#
# Edit the 'find' command below to change the set of files that will be
# modified.
#
# Change the 'sed' command below to change the content that is changed
# in each file and what it is changed to.
#
#=============================================================================
#
# If you need to modify this script, you may want to run each of these
# commands individual from the command line to make sure things are doing
# what you think they should be doing. This is why they are separated into
# steps here.
