      # Checkout the GitHub created reference for the PR.
      # The only way to do this is by using the "issue" number
      # but that is really the PR number in this context.
      # This is due to using an `issue_comment` event which
      # is due to the GitHub Actions API that does not have
      # a `pull_request_comment` event or something similar.
      # This leaves us in a detached head state which is corrected
      # in `apply-style/entrypoint.sh`
