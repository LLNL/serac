# Copilot Code Review Instructions

When reviewing a pull request, apply the guidance below.

## Release Notes

- Determine whether the changes are user-facing.
- Treat user-facing changes as changes that affect behavior, output, interfaces, configuration, command-line options, APIs, workflows, defaults, error messages, or other functionality visible to users.
- If a pull request contains a user-facing change, verify that `RELEASE_NOTES.md` includes an appropriate entry describing the change.

- The release note should:
  - Be very short: normally 1–2 sentences.
  - Describe the change from the user's perspective.
  - Focus on what changed and why it matters to users.
  - Avoid implementation details unless they are necessary for understanding the user-visible behavior.

- If the pull request contains a user-facing change but does not include an appropriate `RELEASE_NOTES.md` entry, leave a review comment requesting one.
- Do not request a release note for changes that are purely internal, such as refactoring, tests, CI changes, formatting, comments, or implementation changes that do not alter user-visible behavior.
